<h4><u><i>The Bhopal School of Social Sciences was founded in the year 1972-at the initiative of Most Rev Dr Eugene D' Souza, the then Archbishop of Bhopal-in response to the need of the time for a broad-based, job-oriented curriculum with an initial focus on social service and entrepreneurship. The institution is supported and managed by the Archdiocese of Bhopal through the BSSS Foundation Society chaired by the Archbishop of Bhopal.
<p>Since its inception, the College has adopted an integrated and comprehensive approach to learning in order to achieve academic excellence. This vision has been the cornerstone of our growth in the last 49 years as we gradually adopted new programs, initiated innovative learner strategies, and took bold steps to go beyond the prescribed curriculum with a view to transform knowledge into affirmative action.</p>
Initially known for its Social Sciences and Management courses, the College grew and diversified with the introduction of courses in Commerce, Information & Technology, Science and Physical Education. Catering to the high demand for Commerce subjects, the College offers a wide range of options including an honours course as well as specializations in Foreign Trade, Travel and Tourism, Banking and Insurance, Taxation, Computer Applications, Advertising, Sales Promotion & Sales Management. Subsequently, post graduate courses in Social work, English Literature, Commerce, Economics, Computer Applications, Sociology, Political Science, Psychology and Business Administration followed. Presently, our Humanities portfolio includes 4 undergraduate honours programs in Social Work, Economics, English literature and Psychology. The College also runs two international MBAs through collaboration with Assumption University, Bangkok and Under Graduate Courses in collaboration with Concordia College, USA. We also have tie-up with IMA, US and ACCA, UK.</u></i></h4>
